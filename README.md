# Marginalism Worksheet

A web-based worksheet for Lesson 3 in the Council for Economic Education's forthcoming _High School Economics_ book.

## TODO

* Change the validations so that if you get something that can be parsed to a number, just use that number.
  * Example: If you get "12d", just use 12 and set the input the field to 12.
* Fix the event handling so that you can use the native number input controls and not have them lose focus.
* Dump Bootstrap and style all the things.
